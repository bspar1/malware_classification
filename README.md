# malware_classification

This project classifies apps as malicious or benign based on their usage profiles. To run the project, first compile it and run

java MalwareClassification [malicious_folder] [benign_folder]

malicious_folder: the RELATIVE (not absolute) path to the folder with all of the profiles of malicious code
benign_folder: same as above, but for benign apps.

Profiling data is assumed to be in...whatever format Fisher gave me. (Todo: change this part.)

To run as a jar, first compile using the package-for-store option from build.xml. In Netbeans (which I used to make this project), navigate to build.xml in the "files" view (not projects), right click on build.xml, select "Run Target" -> "other targets" -> "package-for-store". This will package libsvm as well as all of the required code. To run the jar file, use the same syntax as above (but I think you use jar instead of java...need to check this one. I swear it works!)
